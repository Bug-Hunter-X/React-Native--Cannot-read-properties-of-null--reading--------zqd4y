This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or component lifecycles.

```javascript
// Example: Accessing a property of a null object
const user = await getUserData(); // Might return null if the user data isn't available
console.log(user.name); // Error: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')
```
